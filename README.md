The application helps the building manager to arrange building fire safety inspections intuitively and efficiently. This is what our application can do:
Establish building-related materials and items to be inspected;
Establish inspector information;
Assign inspectors to inspect specific buildings, floors and inspection items;
Calculate the inspection progress of the building by checking the completed inspection items;
With the above features, building managers can have their own data collection and analysis systems.
I hope this application can help you.
